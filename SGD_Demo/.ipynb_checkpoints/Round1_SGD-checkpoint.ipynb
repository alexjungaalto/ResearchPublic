    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to find an optimal linear predictor by minimizing the average loss incurred over a training set. This average loss is also known as the **training error** of a precictor. We will detail a simple iterative algorithm which is called **gradient descent** (GD). GD finds an approximate minimizer of the training error by repetedly moving into the opposite gradient direction. We will also discuss a variant of gradient descent which is known as **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD). SGD is one of the most widely used optimization methods within deep learning.\n",

The shape of the MSE loss function is parabola with one minimum value (which is also a [global minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima#/media/File:Extrema_example_original.svg) in this case) and this minimum is corresponding to the lowest MSE loss value. \n",

    "So, how can we find the optimal weight, which gives us a smallest MSE loss possible? \\\n",
    "One way is to use derivative of the function. Briefly, [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) describes the rate of change of a function respectively to change of its argument.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of the MSE loss function with respect to (w.r.t.) weight will tell us how the function is changing when changing the weight value. In the case if we have more parameters of the loss function (more than one weight) we will need to compute not a derivative, but [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) - a vector, which elements are the partial derivatives of loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm, which uses gradient to find a minimum of the loss function is called **gradient descent**. Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm. During each iteration the algorithm estimates how the parameters (weights) of the function should be changed in order to reach the local minimum of the function. More precisely, the gradient of the function is calculated and algorithm \"takes\" small steps in the direction of the steepest descent of the function. Common analogy for this algorithm is taking a path downhill in the mountains [read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient descent algorithm includes following steps:**\n",

    "**1. initialize weights randomly**\\\n",
    "**2. compute predictions, given current weights**\\\n",

    "**5. update the weights - change the weights values to the opposite direction from gradient** `weight = weight - lrate*gradient`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is then repeated pre-defined amount of times (iterations). The `lrate` parameter or **learning rate** (or step size) regulates how large the change of weight value will be. If learning rate is too small (left plot), the algorithm may take too much time to find a minimum (or, in computer science terminology, it will take too much time to converge). If learning rate is too high (right plot), it is possible that weight value will \"move\" to the opposite direction from the optimal weight value (or algorithm will diverge).\n",

In line with loss plots we created above, mini-batch SGD is more noisy than batch GD. Although, it seems that using plain batch GD is faster way to reach the minimum of the loss function, in practice when working with large datasets and thousands parameters (weights) in neural networks, this approach will be slower and more computationally expensive than mini-batch SGD."
